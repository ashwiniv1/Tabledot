                            <p>You hereby acknowledge and agree that the material benefit of Table Dot&rsquo;s bargain hereunder is derived from the collection of fees from Users who receive Services from Chefs solely through relationships that are initiated and intermediated by the Platform.

You must not solicit or permit any Chef to circumvent Table Dot&rsquo;s entitlement to its fees or otherwise divert business away from Table Dot by receiving services similar to the Services from any other Platform participant in any manner other than through the Platform. You shall promptly report to Table Dot any breach or attempted breach of the provisions of this paragraph by any party. Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, your actual or threatened breach of the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall result, without limitation, in:</p>

                                <li>payment by you to Table Dot of an amount equivalent to the fees that would have been collected by Table Dot had the services performed in breach hereof been performed without circumventing the Platform, plus 1.5%/month interest (or such lower amount as may be the maximum amount permitted under applicable law);</li>
                                <li>payment by you to Table Dot of all of our fees and costs (including without limitation reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) arising in connection with our investigation of the applicable breach and collection of the foregoing amounts;</li>

                                <li>if Table Dot in its sole and absolute discretion elects to permit you to resume access to your Account, a reactivation fee to be determined by us as we see fit.</li>

                            <p>Your Account may be used to deposit or receive funds for Services. You may have positive funds in your Account if you have prepaid for fees or charges or for Services to be provided to you via the Platform.</p>
                            <p>Funds in your Account are held by us in our operating accounts held with financial institutions. Funds in your Account are not held separately by us, and may be commingled with our general operating funds, and funds of other Users&rsquo; Accounts.</p>
                            <p>You are not entitled to any interest or other earnings for funds that are in your Account.</p>
                            <p>We may receive interest on funds held by us in our operating accounts from financial institutions with whom we hold our operating accounts. Any such interest earned belongs to us and we will not be liable to any User for any imputed interest on such funds.</p>
                            <p>If your Account has negative funds, we may:</p>
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>set-off the negative amount with funds that you subsequently receive into your Account;</li>
                                <li>if you have funds in multiple currencies in your Account and one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, we may set-off the negative amount against funds you maintain in a different currency (at an exchange rate applied by us);</li>
                                <li>deduct amounts you owe us from money you subsequently add or receive into your Account; or</li>
                                <li>immediately suspend or limit your Account until such time as your Account no longer has a negative amount.
                                        
                                    <p>In the event that we offset a negative amount of funds pursuant to this section, it may be bundled with another debit coming out of your Account.</p>

                            <p>We reserve the right to suspend a User&rsquo;s funds withdrawal request if the source of the funds is suspected to be fraudulent.</p>
                            <p>If we become aware that any funds are transferred into an Account as a result of a fraudulent transaction, this will be reversed immediately. If those funds have already been released to you, you must repay the funds into your Account. If you do not do so, we may suspend, limit, or cancel your Account, or take action against you to recover those funds.</p>
                            <p>We may, in our sole discretion, place a limit on any or all of the funds in your Account (thereby preventing any use of the funds) if:</p>
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>
                                    <p>we believe there may be an unacceptable level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of your transactions, including if we believe that there is a risk that such funds will be subject to reversal or chargeback; or</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>we are required to do so by law or applicable law enforcement agencies.</p>
                                    <p>If you are involved in a dispute, we may (in certain circumstances) place a temporary limit on the funds in your Account to cover the amount of any potential liability. If the dispute is resolved in your favor, we may lift the limit on your funds and those funds may be released to you. If the dispute is not resolved in your favor, we may remove the funds from your Account. We may also place a limit on your Account in circumstances where we suspect you of fraudulent or other unacceptable behavior, while we investigate any such matter.</p>

                            <p>You may ask for a refund at any time for any funds that you have paid into your Account.</p>
                            <p>If we agree to the refund, the funds will be received by the User via the same payment method(s) that the User used to make the original payment to us.</p>
                            <p>We may refund funds to Users irrespective of whether a User has requested funds be refunded if:</p>
                            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                                <li>we are required by law or consider that we are required by law to do so; </li>
                                <li>we determine that refunding funds to the User will avoid any dispute or an increase in our costs;</li>
                                <li>we refund funds to the User in accordance with any refund policy specified by us from time to time;</li>
                                <li>we determine that the original payment made by the User is fraudulent; or</li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>we consider, in our sole opinion, that it is likely that the refund of funds is necessary to avoid a credit card chargeback.</p>
                                    <p>You can request a refund by using our customer support website. You expressly agree to use the dispute resolution process in this Agreement, expressly agree to be bound by its ruling, and expressly agree not to initiate any chargeback request with your card issuer.</p>
                                    <p>If you initiate any chargeback request or other &ldquo;Request for Information&rdquo; or similar process, you expressly agree and consent to us to share any and all information in relation to your agreement to these Terms, in order to defeat any such chargeback request.</p>
                                    <p>If you have already initiated a chargeback request with your credit card issuer, you must not request a refund of funds by contacting us and must not seek double recovery.</p>
                                    <p>If we reasonably determine, having considered all the relevant circumstances, that you have made an excessive or unreasonable number of requests to refund funds back to you or chargebacks, we may suspend, limit, or close your Account.</p>

                            <p>You agree that we may reverse any such payments made to you, which are subject to chargeback or reversal instruction via your payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors). If you initiate any chargeback request or other &ldquo;Request for Information&rdquo; or similar process, you expressly agree and consent to us to share any and all information in relation to your agreement of these terms and conditions, in order to defeat any such chargeback request.</p>

                                    <p>In the event that we close your Account, you will have no claim whatsoever against us in respect of any such suspension or termination of your Account, other than for recovery of funds to which you are then validly entitled.</p>

                            <h5>Disputes</h5>
                            <p>If a dispute arises between you and Table Dot, our goal is to address your concerns immediately and, if we are unable to do so, to provide you with a means of resolving the dispute quickly. We strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by using our customer support website or emailing us at support@TableDot.com.</p>
                            <p>For any claim, Table Dot may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. If Table Dot elects arbitration, such arbitration will be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider, which is to be selected by you from a panel of ADR providers that Table Dot will provide to you. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, or be solely based on written submissions; (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>All claims you bring against Table Dot must be resolved in accordance with these Terms. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Agreement shall be considered improperly filed and a breach of these Terms. Should you file a claim contrary to these Terms, Table Dot may recover its legal fees and costs (including without limitation in-house lawyer and paralegal fees), provided that Table Dot has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>
                            <p>You agree that you will not pursue any claims arising under this Agreement on a class action or other representative basis, and will not seek to coordinate or consolidate any arbitration or action hereunder with any other proceeding.</p>
                            <p>If any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any provision of any bankruptcy or insolvency law, Table Dot will be entitled to recover all reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement.</p>
                            <p>Table Dot&rsquo;s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>

                            <h5>Survival and Release</h5>
                            <p>This Agreement, including any addenda hereto, supersedes any other agreement between you and the Company and contains the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof.</p>
                            <p>If any part of this document is found to be unenforceable, that part will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this document will otherwise remain in full force and effect. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. Any invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed severed from this Agreement to the extent of its invalidity or unenforceability, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the Agreement did not contain that particular provision to the extent of its invalidity or unenforceability.</p>
                            <p>Our failure to enforce any part of this document is not a waiver of any of our rights to later enforce that or any other part of this documents. The waiver of any breach of any term, covenant or condition herein contained, or our failure to seek redress for the violation of, or to insist upon the strict performance of, any covenant or condition of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such term, covenant or condition or any subsequent breach of the same.</p>
                            <p>We may assign any of our rights and obligations under this document from time to time.</p>
                            <p>If there is a dispute between participants on the Platform, or between Users and any third party, the Company is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other Users or Chefs, you release the Company, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and the Platform. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: &ldquo;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.&rdquo;</p>
